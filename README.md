# Top 50 Most Visited Countries Database - Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview:
This project aims to provide a comprehensive database for understanding the top 50 most visited countries in the world. The dataset includes various factors such as affordability, number of UNESCO Heritage Sites, safety, infrastructure, income group, and more. The database serves two purposes: 

1. To facilitate the analysis of patterns and characteristics behind the most visited countries.
2. To act as a guide for travelers seeking to choose a tourism destination based on specific criteria.

Data was collected from different sources, including Kaggle for the most visited countries dataset, web scraping using BeautifulSoup for safety information and number of UNESCO Heritage Sites, and the Travel & Tourism Development Index from the World Travel Organization for additional variables.

The collected data was cleaned and merged into the "tourism_database" table, which was then uploaded to an SQL database. 

## Purpose of the Data Visualization Project:
The purpose of this data visualization project is to visually explore the collected data, identify trends, and analyze patterns that characterize the most visited countries in the world. By enriching the analysis with additional variables, the project aims to provide further insights into what makes these countries popular destinations.

To achieve this, two new categories were added to the dataset, obtained from the World Economic Forum Tourism Development Index. The data was cleaned and transformed using the "tourism_notebook.pynb" notebook, resulting in the "tourism_index.csv" file. This file was then imported into Tableau for visualization.


The Tableau visualizations consist of several dashboards, organized into a cohesive story. The project findings reveal significant insights regarding the most visited countries, their characteristics, and potential correlations among the analyzed variables. Some of them will be detailed below:

- In this page we can visualize the most visited countries and regions, as well as the leading nations amongst these. Clearly, the Europe and Eurasia region dominates the global tourism industry concentrating more then half of all tourism inflows. France, Spain and the United States are the top 3 global destinations by number of arrivals. In total, the top 50 most visited nations concentrate around 90% of global tourism.

- In this second group of visuals, we can see how almost 70% of global tourism is concentrated in high-income economies. That proportion goes up to 90% if upper-middle income economies are included. The remaining percentage is shared primarily by lower-middle income economies while the lowest income percentile has no representatives in the top 50 most visited countries. On the right, the most visited nations divided by income groups are made visible.
